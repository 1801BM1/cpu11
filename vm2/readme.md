## 1801BM2

The 1801BM2 is single chip microprocessor, was designed in first half of 1980-th and
had PDP-11 compatible architecture. Notable, it was not an exact clone of one of original
DEC processors, but had its own internal architecture and PLM-based state machine. 

The 1801BM2 is the futher development of 1801BM1, MUL and DIV instructions added, the
two-stage pipeline and instruction prefetch were implemented, the microinstructions
took only one internal clock to complete (1801BM1 required two clock periods per
microinstruction). These features improved the processor performance significantly.
